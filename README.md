## INTRODUCTION

This is a one sample test to compare two means (Men and Women) peformance through hypothesis testing.

### RELEVANCE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTING IN A BUSISNESS SETTING

Hypothesis testing is very important in business analytics for decision making for example, if an Ecommerce business want to change their delivery company for a faster one, they need to run a hypothesis test with samples and compare if there is a difference between the time it takes to make delivery between the old and the new company. This will help stake-holders to make decision whether to continue with the old company or switch to the new one.

## A GLANCE AT THE TASK

Looking at this question, the average score of the female population is known and that of the men is not known. 
Now the tricky part is that the question is asking that I assume that the men and women have the same average score.

## DECIDING ON STATISTICAL TEST TO USE

in deciding the statistical test to use for comparing means, I need to consider if the population standard deviation is 
given or not. Here, the question stated it clearly that the population standard deviation is not given so I have no option 
than to use a T-test.

## DECISION


## CONFIDENCE INTERVAL

since the average score of Men and Women are not the same, I need to know a range for the average score of men, in order to know this, I have to do a confidence interval calculation.

so from the sample so far, I can say that I am 95% confident that the mean of score of Men will be between 62.78 and 67.47
